Customer Analysis

This script performs data segmentation analysis on a customer dataset, utilizing K-means clustering and data scaling techniques for improved model performance. It incorporates data preprocessing steps, including data scaling with MinMaxScaler and a robust logging system for tracking execution and debugging. The core of the analysis relies on K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments based on numerical features, and the use of `MinMaxScaler` improves clustering results, enabling further analysis of segment characteristics.
